# dotfiles
Configuration files I use across machines.

### Directory structure
- Clone this repo in your home directory and rename it to `.config`. This is enough for the
`nvim` and `iterm2` configs.
- `.vimrc` - move to `~`
- `.zshrc` - move to `~`
- `keybindings.json` - check how `VSCode` configures that


### Developing
There is a `beta` branch that should normally have the latest changes. I'm doing this just so that I don't create PR for every single change I make to my dotfiles.
